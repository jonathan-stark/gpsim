gpsim/cli provides the command line interface for gpsim. As of gpsim-0.0.13, lex & yacc (or actually flex & bison) are used as the parser and the lexical analyzer. Together, these provide gpsim's grammar. The gnu readline library provides command line editing like you find in most terminal programs. This textual interface is very similar to gdb.

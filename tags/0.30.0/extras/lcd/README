lcd-0.2.1  - An LCD emulator for gpsim


The purpose of this program is to emulate the ubiquitous character
type LCD displays. Most, but not all of the LCD's features are
emulated. The notably absent feature is the ability to read the
CGRAM and DDRAM. These will get added.

See INSTALL for instructions on running the examples.

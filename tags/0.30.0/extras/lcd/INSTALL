Installation instructions
-------------------------

You'll need at least gpsim-0.21.2 for this to work.

un tar the lcd-0.2.1.tar.gz tarball and then:

$ cd lcd-0.2.1
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit

At this point, the LCD module has been compiled and installed
as a shared library that can be loaded by gpsim. If you want to
see if it works, then run the example:

$ cd lcd-0.2.1/examples
$ gpasm lcd_mod.asm
$ gpsim -c lcd_mod.stc

This will assemble the pic assembly code that test the LCD module.
This code is fairly complete and can be used as an LCD driver for
a real PIC/LCD board.

When gpsim comes up, you should see the LCD display. A dark line
will appear on the first row just like it does for a real LCD. When
the test program is executed, the LCD will be initialized and the 
message "GPSIM WROTE THIS" will be repeatedly written. The LCD is
not automatically updated, so you'll have to force a manual refresh
by partially hiding the LCD window and then re-exposing it.


This module has been integrated into the gpsim sources, so no
seperate processes are required to build or install this module.

LCD Example

This is a full-blown example of an PIC LCD interface. It's here
to illustrace the LCD module interface to gpsim. However, the
code doesn't know it's running on a module! In other words, you
can use this code in a real PIC driving a real LCD. 

---------
Building

The Makefile in this directory is for the top level packager. So
to "build" the project, do this:


$ gpasm lcd_mod.asm

This should assemble with no errors.

$ gpsim -c lcd_mod.stc

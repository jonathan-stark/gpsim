  gpsim_modules.cc

  gpsim supports modules, or thingies, that are not part of gpsim proper.
This is to say, that the modules are not compiled and linked with the
core gpsim software. Instead, they are compiled and linked separately and
then dynamically loaded by gpsim. This approach provides a flexibility
to the user to create customized objects for simulation purposes. The
big benefit of course, is that the user doesn't have to get bogged down
in to the nitty-gritty details of the way gpsim is designed. The templates
provided here can serve as a relatively simple example of how one may
go about creating customized modules.

Please see the README.MODULES for more details on how modules are intended
to be used.

Here are a list of functions that a gpsim compliant module library should
support:

  void mod_list(void) - Prints a list of the modules in a library
  Module_Types * get_mod_list(void)  - Obtain pointer to the list of modules

This module has now been integrated into the gpsim source tree,
so no seperate process is required to build or install the module.

At this point, the Graphic LCD module has been compiled and installed
as a shared library that can be loaded by gpsim. If you want to
see if it works, then run the example:

$ cd graphic_lcd-X.Y.Z/examples
$ make
$ gpsim -s glcd_test.cod

This will assemble the PIC code that tests the LCD module.This code is
fairly complete and can be used as an LCD driver for a real PIC/LCD board.

When gpsim comes up, you should see the Graphic LCD display. A random
number of pixels will be on. As you single step through the code, you
can see some of the test patterns written to the display.

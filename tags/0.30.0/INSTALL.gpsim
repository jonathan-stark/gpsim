1.0 Installation instructions
    -------------------------



INSTALLATION (the most common way)
----------------------------------

If you've ever installed software under Linux/UNIX before, then this 
will be completely familiar to you.

1) create a parent subdirectory for gpsim (e.g. gnupic)

$ mkdir ~/gnupic       # choose whatever directory name you like

2) Copy the tar ball to this directory and expand it:

$ cd ~/gnupic
$ mv the_path_of_where_ever_the_tarball_is/gpsim-0.x.y.tar.gz .
$ tar -xvzf gpsim-0.x.y.tar.gz

(Where 'x.y' is the release number.) This will create a subdirectory
called gpsim-0.x.y . All of gpsim's source code will be untarred to
here.

3) cd gpsim-0.x.y

4) ./configure

This will check your system for the proper tools necessary to build
gpsim and then it will create Makefiles.

5) make all

This will create the executable.

6) su root . You'll need su privileges to complete the install. If you
   don't have root privileges or don't wish to install gpsim in the
   /usr/local/bin directory, then see the steps below on building
   without root privileges.

7) make install
This copies the executable into the /usr/local/bin subdirectory. 


1.1 Dependencies

The most significant non-common gpsim dependency is on the gtkextra
package: http://gtkextra.sourceforge.net/

Other dependencies include gtk-2.0, readline, popt. These packages
should be installed on most distributions. However, it should be noted
that the "developer" version are required if you're building gpsim
from the source.


2.0 HOW TO BUILD gpsim WITHOUT THE GUI
    ----------------------------------


Repeat steps 1,2, and 3 from above.

4) ./configure --disable-gui

Note: if you already have built gpsim with the gui support and then
decide you want to take it out, then you'll also needed to do a 'make
clean' before you do the 'make' in step 5. The make clean will remove
all of the old object files.


3.0 HOW TO BUILD gpsim WITHOUT ROOT PRIVILEGES
    ------------------------------------------

Contributed by Erik Thiele <mailto:erikyyy@erikyyy.de>

(
Preface by Scott:

Erik has created a step-by-step list of instructions for
completely installing gpsim into a local directory. If you
do not have root priviledges or just do not wish to install 
gpsim into the default directories then these instructions 
are for you.
)


 first create your local installation directory,
# if you don't already have one.
mkdir $HOME/localinst

# now make the directory where you compile the programs in.
mkdir $HOME/compiling

# go into that directory
cd $HOME/compiling
# now download exdbm-VERSION-tar.gz and
# gpsim-VERSION-tar.gz into the current directory.
# also download gtk+extra-VERSION-tar.gz
# if your distribution doesn't contain it. just start
gtkextra-config
# if that program was not found, you need to install gtk+extra

# now let's first compile and install gtk+extra
# you can skip this step if you already have gtk+extra installed.
cd $HOME/compiling
tar xzvf gtk+extra-VERSION-tar.gz
cd gtk+extra-VERSION-
./configure --prefix=$HOME/localinst/gtk+extra
make install
cd $HOME
# edit your shell configuration and add something like
export PATH="$PATH":$HOME/localinst/gtk+extra/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":$HOME/localinst/gtk+extra/lib
# don't forget to relogin to let changes take effect.
# now you can try to execute
gtkextra-config
# if it worked, gtk+extra is now installed.

# now lets install exdbm library.
cd $HOME/compiling
tar xzvf exdbm-VERSION-tar.gz
cd exdbm-VERSION-
./configure --prefix=$HOME/localinst/eXdbm
make install
cd $HOME
# edit your shell configuration and add something like
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":~/localinst/eXdbm/lib
# don't forget to relogin to let changes take effect.

# now lets install gpsim
cd $HOME/compiling
tar xzvf gpsim-VERSION-tar.gz
cd gpsim-VERSION-
./configure --with-exdbm=$HOME/localinst/eXdbm --prefix=$HOME/localinst/gpsim
make install
cd $HOME
# edit your shell configuration and add something like
export PATH="$PATH":$HOME/localinst/gpsim/bin
# don't forget to relogin to let changes take effect.

# if you want to save diskspace you can now do
rm -rf $HOME/compiling/eXdbm
rm -rf $HOME/compiling/gpsim
rm -rf $HOME/compiling/gtk+extra
# as these files were only needed for compiling and installation.



4.0 HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN gpsim DISTRIBUTION
    ---------------------------------------

Since gpsim uses automake, you get a whole lot of features for free. I
won't go into all of them, but sometimes you might want to tweak gpsim
and make your own tar ball. All you have to do is:

$ make dist

If you want to dink the rev numbers, then edit gpsim-0.x.y/configure.in and then from within gpsim-0.x.y/ :

$ automake
$ autoconf
$ ./configure 
$ make dist

5.0 INSTALLING gtk+-extra
    -------------------------------

First, you're going to need to grab gtk+-extra. The best place to get
this is from gpsim's web page since gtk+extra's page doesn't have a
valid tar ball...

$ tar -xvzf package.tar.gz
$ cd package
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
$ make install
$ exit

Where package is gtk+-extra.


6.0 INSTALLING RPM's
    ----------------

gpsim has two RPM's that both must be install. In addition, gpsim
depends gtk+extra's RPMs. First, get the latest versions of:

   gtk+extra2-LATEST.rpm
   gtk+extra2-devel-LATEST.rpm
   gpsim-LATEST.rpm
   gpsim-devel-LATEST.rpm

As root, install gtk+extra:
# rpm -ihv gtk+extra2-LATEST.rpm
# rpm -ihv gtk+extra2-devel-LATEST.rpm

Then gpsim

# rpm -ihv gpsim-devel-LATEST.rpm
# rpm -ihv gpsim-LATEST.rpm

Note that the order is important (and rpm will tell you if you're wrong).

7.0 MAC OS
    ------

There's a conflict with shared libraries and gpsim on the new MAC OS's. So for the MAC, configure gpsim like so:

$ ./configure --disable-shared

8.0 Windows
    -------

Borut Razem has ported gpsim to windows. See 

http://gpsim.sourceforge.net/gpsimWin32/gpsimWin32.html

for details on how to build and install gpsim Under Windows.


9.0 CVS & SVN
     ---------

CVS is no longer supported. 

See http://gpsim.sourceforge.net/gpsim_cvs.html for instructions on
how to retrieve and build gpsim from SVN repository.

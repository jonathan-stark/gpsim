gpsim/examples/projects/

In this directory you'll find sample projects that can serve
as a template for creating a new project. Each project here
attempts to be very simple to illustrate one or two new points.
If you want to see an example of a more sophisticated project
the please look at gpsim's CVS in the extras/ directory. In
there you'll find the LCD module example.


digital_stim/ - This project illustrates the use of asynchronous
                stimuli. The gpsim start up command script is 
                also introduced.

stack_test/  - This project illustrates the how gpsim simulates
               the mid-range core's stack. A trivial multi-tasking
               switcher is implemented by taking advantage of
               the circular stack.

p16f628_test/ - This project tests all aspects of the 16f628. 
                The '628 is rapidly replacing the 'f84 as the
                PIC of choice among hobbiest.

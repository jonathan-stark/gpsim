The tests the USART module with the GUI fix. 

The code for a 16f628 PIC is used. The code first transmits a string of 
characters, which are instructions to the user, to the USART module which
will then be displayed on its GUI.  This verifies that the USART can receive
serial data. 

When the focus is on the USART GUI window, characters typed on the keyboard 
are sent from the USART to the PIC and then retransmitted from the PIC back 
to the USART.

If all works, the typed characters will be displayed in the GUI text window
of the USART.  Both transmit and receive must be functioning for this to 
happen.

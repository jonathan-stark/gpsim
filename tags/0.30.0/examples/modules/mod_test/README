mod_test

The mod_test is a very simple example of PIC code interfacing with
gpsim modules. The modules illustrated are pullup and pulldown
resistors. Two of each are instantiated and connected to the lower
nibble of portb. 

The PIC program is a simple loop that writes values out to port B. 


RUNNING

The example is run by:


  $ gpsim -c mod_test.stc

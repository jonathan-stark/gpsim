gpsim USART example

This example illustrates how gpsim's USART module can be connected to
a PIC. The test program usart_test.asm contains embedded simulation
commands. The .sim commands will load a USART module and connect it to
the PIC. The .assert simulation commands verify that the assemble
program runs correctly. The assembly program displays the pattern
0123456789ABCD.

# Script for testing modules
#
# The purpose of this script is to load a simple
# program for a PIC (16F84), load the gpsim module library,
# and illustrate how modules can be connected to pics.

# This program does nothing but continuously increment portb

load s mod_test.cod

# load the gpsim module library. Not that this is a 'shared library'.
# If the library fails to load then 1) it's not installed (try installing
# gpsim) 2) or the path to library is not available (see the documentation
# on modules). 

module library libgpsim_modules.so

# display all of the modules that are in the library:
# module list

# load a specific module from the module library and give it a name

module load binary_indicator bi1

# create a node that can connect the Pic and the module.

node n1

attach n1 portb0 bin_port0

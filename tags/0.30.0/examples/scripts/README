Scripting

DEC04

This directory illustrates some basic gpsim scripting.

NOTE: As of this writing, the Python scripts are not working!

What's here:
-----------

The script 'client.cc' is a C++ program that's designed to interface
with gpsim through a socket interface. This script will load the PIC
program gensquares.cod and instrument it with some regression testing
tools. The comments in client.cc discuss what exactly is tested in the
example regression test.

How to use it
-------------

The makefile will do two things: it'll assemble the PIC program
gensquares.asm and it will compile the C++ script client.cc. Typing
'make' at the command line should execute both of these rules.

The script is designed to communicate with gpsim. So gpsim needs to be
running first. Once that's done, the script can be run:

$ make
$ ./client

And it should respond with:

The simulation passed!

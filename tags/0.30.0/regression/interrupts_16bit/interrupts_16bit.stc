# This stimulation file illustrates how two (or more)
# iopins may be connected to one another. In this example,
# port A bit 4 is tied to port B bit 0. 
# Also, note that this file does not define the processor
# or the source .hex ... 

echo I/O pin Stimulus file that connects port A 4
echo port B 0.

# Define a node to which the pins can attach.

node test_node

# Now specify which two I/O pins are attached to the
# new node. Note, that it is possible to specify more
# than two iopins (or two of any stimuli). The iopins
# are assigned the names portxn - where x is a,b,c,d,e
# and n is 0 through 7.

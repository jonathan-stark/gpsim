<h1>gpsim SVN</h1>
</center>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you need the latest processors,  peripherals and fixes which have not yet
been included in the most recent release, you can get the code straight from
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/gpsim/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/">gpsim's
SVN repository</a>
on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gpsim/">gpsim's
SourceForge Page</a> , which is of course hosted by 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. 
</p><p>
Although every effort is made by the developers to maintain the
SVN code in a usable state, problems may occur with it from time to time.
Thus be prepared to either 
request assistance from the
<a href="mailto:gpsim-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">
gpsim-devel mailing list.</a>
or file a 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/gpsim/bugs/">
bug report</a> when using the SVN.
</p>
<h2> Getting the source</h2>
<p>
To create a local only copy of the latest gpsim sources from the SVN repository run the following command:
</p>
<pre>
$ svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/gpsim/code/trunk gpsim-code
</pre>
<p>
Where gpsim-code can be changed to any directory name you wish. 
You'll need about 45M of disc
space to get a copy of the repository. 
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Getting updates from SVN</h2>
<p>
If one of the developers makes a change to SVN and you just want to update your
local copy, then all you need to do is this:
</p>
<pre>svn update<br /></pre>
<p>
The 'update' command will compare your local copy with the master SVN copy and
then update yours with the differences. It's a whole faster than re-downloading
everything.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Compiling your SVN copy the first time</h2>
<p>When you get the code from SVN this first time, you'll have to go through a
couple of extra steps to build it. But those steps are really simple. In the
directory you downloaded gpsim from SVN, enter these commands:
</p>
<pre>$ ./autogen.sh<br />$ ./configure<br />$ make<br /></pre>
<p>
Go get a cup of coffee and read <a href="http://slashdot.org">/.</a>
as your computer cranks through compiling gpsim. When it's done, you can then install it:
</p>
<p>
On multi-core processors the compile time can be shortened by running parallel make
by using the command "make -j n" where n is 2 * number of cores.
</p>
<pre>$ su root<br /># make install<br /># exit<br /></pre>
<p>
And you should be ready to go!
</p>
<h2>Extra Build Details</h2>
<p>The instructions given above are suitable for building gpsim. However, it's
possible to embed gpsim into a custom simulation environment (see 
<a href="http://ktechlab.org/">KTechLab</a>). These
simulation environments may have special requirements for building or configuring gpsim. For
example, if shared libraries required:
</p>
<p> </p>
<pre> [gpsim] $ ./configure --enable-shared<br /> </pre>
<p></p>
<p>
Or if the socket interface is required:
</p>
<p> </p>
<pre> [gpsim] $ ./configure --enable-sockets<br /> </pre>
<p></p>
<h2>Building Libraries and Modules</h2>
<p> The main gpsim source contains several simple library modules. When you build
and install gpsim these are installed too. These modules are placed into a shared library
(or DLL under windows). Thus gpsim will use your OS' library loading mechanism to find
them. A common mistake here is that the modules get installed into a directory for which
the OS has no path. On Linux, the modules are installed by default into /usr/local/lib/.
If you choose to keep this default location (there's nothing wrong with that), you'll need to
add a path to it. This is done by placing adding the path to the file /etc/ld.so.conf
</p>
<p>
</p>
<pre> $ su # become root<br /> # edit /etc/ld.so.conf by adding the line /usr/local/lib to it<br /> # cat /etc/ld.so.conf<br />include ld.so.conf.d/*.conf<br />/usr/X11R6/lib<br />/usr/X11R6/lib64<br />/usr/lib/mysql<br />/usr/lib64/mysql<br />/usr/local/lib<br /> # /sbin/ldconfig # refresh the cached library search paths<br /> # exit<br /></pre>

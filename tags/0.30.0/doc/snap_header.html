  <h1>gpsim - Snapshots</h1>
  <hr />
  <h2>Occasionally Updated Snapshots</h2>
  <p>These snapshots are occasionally updated from the
developmental code in the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=2341">Subversion</a> server.
They are <i>not</i>
official releases and should be considered "beta" quality. Some may not
even work at all if a serious bug was introduced during development, so
several are provided to give you the best chance of finding one that
will work.</p>
  <p>Because official gpsim releases are infrequent, these
snapshots often contain fixes for bugs discovered in the last official
release. If you do encounter a bug, please test the latest snapshot
build to see if it has already been fixed by a developer.</p>
  <p>To see what developers have added, you can view the
  <a href="http://gpsim.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gpsim/trunk/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>
directly from the Subversion server.</p>

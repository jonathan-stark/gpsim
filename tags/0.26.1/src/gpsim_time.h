// Cycle Counter
//
// The cycle counter class is used to coordinate the timing 
// between the different peripherals within a processor and
// in some cases, the timing between several simulated processors
// and modules.
//
// The smallest quantum of simulated time is called a 'cycle'.
// The simuluation engine increments a 'Cycle Counter' at quantum
// simulation step. Simulation objects that wished to be notified
// at a specific instance in time can set a cycle counter break
// point that will get invoked whenever the cycle counter reaches
// that instance.

//
// This is a friend class to the Cycle Counter class. Its purpose
// is to maintain a doubly linked list of cycle counter break
// points.

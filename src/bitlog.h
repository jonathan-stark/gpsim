/**********************************************************************
 * boolean event logging
 *
 * The boolean event logger is a simple class for logging the time
 * of boolean (i.e. 0/1) events.
 *
 * The event buffer is an array of 64-bit wide elements. Each element
 * stores the time at which an event occurs. The state of the event
 * is encoded in the position of the array. In other words, "high"
 * events are at the odd indices of the array and "low" ones at the
 * even ones.
 *
 * No effort is made to compress the 64-bit time entries into smaller
 * values. Consequently, a large amount of space is wasted.
 *
 * Repeated events are not logged. E.g.. if two 1's are logged, the
 * second one is ignored.
 *
 * The total number of events is defined when the class is instantiated.
 * The only requirement is that the number of events be an even power
 * of 2. A check for this is made, and
